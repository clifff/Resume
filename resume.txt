##Projects

###[Ujima Project](http://ujima-project.org)    
Developed the entire Ujima Project website. Ujima aims to collect and visualize international datasets for investigative journalists. The site is primarily written in Ruby on Rails, with a bit of jQuery UI on the front end. I also configured the production server, which runs nginx/Passenger and is administered using Capistrano. The DB layer is all MySQL.

###[Anesthesia Simulation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n0w7_tca2I)
Designed and developed a simulated anesthesia tool-set (ventilator, vital signs display, drug table, etc) for use in an industrial engineers PhD research. Written it C++, it used four touchscreen monitors for input and networked with another computer that simulated the operating table. I used the SFML library for the graphics and multithreading.

###[Michigan Daily Mobile](http://m.michigandaily.com/#frontPage)  
Designed the Michigan Daily mobile website. It is meant to be used for touchbased WebKit browsers. Built with a jQuery plugin (jQTouch), CSS,  some backend PHP, and a lot of AJAX.  

###Research Database Mangement  
Created and maintained a MySQL database for analysis of simulation data for an industrial engineering PhD candidateâ€™s research. Wrote an AJAX/PHP web interface to batch upload/parse data, and generated data analysis per research requirements with PHP and SQL queries.  

###[Senior Design - Music Report](http://bit.ly/musicReportIntro)
